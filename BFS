BFS works on queue hence it always first finds vertices at distance of 1 then at distance of 2 ,then 3 and so on.
(Edge weights are considered to be 1,only then)

Hence the shortest path is the one in which it was discovered.

The given BFS algorithm turns an edge gray  only once,and only once is d[v] changed.
