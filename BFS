BFS works on queue hence it always first finds vertices at distance of 1 then at distance of 2 ,then 3 and so on.
(Edge weights are considered to be 1,only then)

Hence the shortest path is the one in which it was discovered.

The given BFS algorithm turns an edge gray  only once,and only once is d[v] changed.



In BFS,
If there is a vertex in the queue at a distance of 1 from the source then,
there will be no element in the queue which is at a distance of 3 or more from the source.

This is so because  when vertices at a distances of 1 are being dequeued vertices of distances of 2 will only be added in the queue.

When all the vertices at distances are dequeued then only vertices of distance 2 will be read from queue and vertices of distance 3 will be added.
